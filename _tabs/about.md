**Network Analyst & Security Aspirant**

I'm a Network Operations Center (NOC) Analyst with a passion for cybersecurity. I'm particularly interested in penetration testing and computer networking, with experience configuring and managing Cisco and Palo Alto equipment. 

Beyond security, I'm a Linux enthusiast with a strong foundation in various distributions and their diverse applications. I actively seek out online challenges to hone my skills and continuously expand my knowledge. My ultimate goal is to transition into a professional penetration testing role.

While cybersecurity is a captivating field, I also hold a deep appreciation for the elegance and reliability of well-designed computer networks. They form the backbone of our digital communication, facilitating access to an ocean of information. 

I'm here to connect with like-minded individuals and share my experiences and knowledge. feel free to contact me :)

**Best,**
